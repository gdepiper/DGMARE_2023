- Biggest impediment to integrating economics is engaging too late

# What is Economics?

*American Economic Association, 2023:*

"Economics can be defined in a few different ways. It’s the study of scarcity, the study of how people use resources and respond to incentives, or the study of decision-making."

# How does this apply to EBM?

.pull-left[1. Natural resources are scarce
  + How do we maximize the value derived?
  
2. Are stakeholder incentives aligned to achieve societal goals?
  + Is the market missing anything?

Total economic value = use value (market & non-market) + non-use value

* Use includes option value & supporting services

* Non-use can only be measured by stated preferences

# Ecosystem-based management considers trade-offs

Economics can help inform not only what to do, but how to do it
* Benefits & Costs
  + Non-Market Goods
  + Externalities
* Incentives
